# LegacyKnockback
A highly customizable knockback editor for BDS+EZ 1.16.20

## Features:

- client-auth sprint resetting mechanics (W-tapping increases knockback to damaged entity)
- server-auth sprint resetting mechanics (attacking force-cancels your sprint)
- fixed a bug where being hit with a projectile then by fist would bypass the 10 tick hurt cooldown
- introduce a "reducing" system, where attacking on the same tick that knockback is administered will multiply your knockback by a configurable factor
- configurable normal knockback and w-tap knockback power + height
- configurable netherite armor knockback resistance
- configurable projectile knockback (for fishing rods, snowballs, and eggs currently)
